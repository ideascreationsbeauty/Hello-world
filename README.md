# Hello-world
Brand new repository

Hi there!
So, I'm new to Github, know nothing about it. I thought it was going to teach me code, which I think is cool and important to know how to use when you own a theme. That way, you can make any changes you want with your theme. I love learning new things, and learn hard things very quickly. My 2 boys, and being married for 13 years isn't slowing me down one bit!
